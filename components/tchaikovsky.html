                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>A Russian composer of the Romantic era, celebrated for his profound impact on classical music. Born
                    in Votkinsk, Russia, Tchaikovsky initially studied law before dedicating himself to music at the
                    Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His works, spanning symphonies, concertos, operas, ballets, and
                    chamber music, are characterized by beautiful melodies, rich orchestration, and deep emotionality.
                    Notable compositions include the ballets "Swan Lake" and "The Nutcracker", the "1812 Overture", and
                    the "Symphony No. 5". Tchaikovsky passed away in Saint Petersburg, but his music continues to be
                    performed and cherished around the world.</p>

                <h3>Musical styles</h3>
                <p>
                    He is known for combining Russian traditions with Western compositional practices. His music is
                    characterized by deeply emotive melodies, a wide range of moods, rich and colorful orchestration,
                    and a mastery of form. Tchaikovsky often infused his music with elements of Russian folk music,
                    lending a distinct nationalistic flavor to many of his compositions. His works are celebrated for
                    their expressiveness and their ability to evoke powerful emotions.</p>
