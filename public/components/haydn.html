                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>An Austrian composer of the Classical period, often referred to as the "Father of the Symphony" and
                    "Father of the String Quartet" due to his pivotal role in the development of these forms. Born in a
                    humble family, Haydn displayed musical talent early and was accepted into the choir of St. Stephen's
                    Cathedral in Vienna, where he gained his musical training. He spent much of his career as a court
                    musician for the wealthy Esterházy family, which provided him the opportunity to experiment and
                    refine his compositions. Haydn's works, including symphonies, string quartets, and piano sonatas,
                    are known for their development of the classical style, innovative form, and the use of folk-like
                    themes. He also mentored and tutored many composers, including Ludwig van Beethoven, further
                    cementing his legacy.</p>

                <h3>Musical styles</h3>
                <p>
                    He was a central figure in the development of the Classical style, characterized by clarity,
                    balance, and transparency. His works are known for their humor, use of folk-like melodies,
                    exploration of new forms, and development of the sonata form. Haydn's innovative approach to musical
                    structure and his expansion of the size and scope of instrumental genres like the symphony and
                    string quartet had a significant influence on composers who followed, particularly Mozart and
                    Beethoven.</p>

                <h3>Trivia or Fun Facts</h3>
                <p>
                    Joseph Haydn was a playful character with a knack for musical jokes. In his "Surprise" Symphony, he
                    famously wrote a sudden loud chord to wake up the audience. He was employed by the Esterházy family
                    for nearly 40 years, where he had a private orchestra at his disposal but was isolated from other
                    composers and trends. He was a mentor to Mozart and a teacher of Beethoven. Interestingly, Haydn
                    never married for love. He was unhappily married to Maria Anna Keller, who showed no interest in his
                    music.</p>

                <h3>Influences and Legacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Haydn is often called the "Father of the Symphony" and the "Father of the String Quartet" because of
                    his significant contributions to these forms. His work served as a foundation for the later
                    development of the sonata form. Haydn's music, known for its humor, inventiveness, and formal
                    mastery, had a profound influence on his contemporaries, including Mozart, and on future composers,
                    notably Beethoven. His creation of the "London" symphonies further established the popularity of the
                    symphony and set the stage for the next century of orchestral music..</p>
