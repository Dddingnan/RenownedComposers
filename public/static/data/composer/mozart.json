    "Trivia": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a prodigious talent from a very young age. He composed his first piece of music, Andante in C, when he was just five years old. Despite his incredible talent, Mozart was known for his playful and often mischievous personality. He loved billiards and dancing, was fond of practical jokes, and had a fascination with scatological humor, which is reflected in many of his letters. Another fascinating aspect of Mozart's life is his mysterious relationship with the Freemasons â€“ he was a member, and many believe his music contains Masonic symbolism.",
