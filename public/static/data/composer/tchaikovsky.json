    "Trivia": "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was one of the first composers to support himself solely through composition and related activities without relying on a patron. He was emotionally expressive and used music as a way to navigate his turbulent emotions. Tchaikovsky was a devoted correspondent and wrote over 5,000 letters in his lifetime. His fear of his own conducting was so severe that he believed his head would fall off while conducting, leading him to hold his chin during performances.",
